Docker Compose is a tool that lets you define and run multi-container Docker applications using a simple YAML file (docker-compose.yml).
Instead of running multiple docker run commands manually, you define everything in one file and run it all with one command.

Key Features:
Run multiple containers together (e.g., web + DB)
Easy to manage services
Network, volumes, ports â€” all in one config file
Great for development, testing, and CI/CD
