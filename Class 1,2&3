what is docker and why it is important?

Docker is a containerization platform that helps developers package applications and their dependencies into lightweight, portable containers. 
These containers can run consistently across different environments, from a developer’s laptop to production servers.

Why is Docker important?
Portability – Works the same on any system (Linux, Windows, cloud, etc.).
Efficiency – Uses fewer resources than traditional virtual machines.
Faster Deployment – Quickly start and stop applications.
Consistency – Eliminates "it works on my machine" issues.
Scalability – Easily scale applications using container orchestration tools like Kubernetes.

Commands:
Docker install on linux server : yum install docker -y

Basic Docker Commands:

docker -v or docker --version -> to check the installed docker version
docker info -->  Displays system-wide information about Docker.
docker pull <image name>  --> pull the image from docker hub
example: docker pull amazonlinux
docker images --> show all downloaded images
docker ps -a --> show all containers including stopped ones
docker ps --> shows active containers
docker stop/start/pause/unpause <container_id>  --->stop/start/pause/unpause a running container
docker rm <container_id> -> deletes a stopped container
docker rmi <image_id> --> deletes a docker image
docker logs <container_id> --> Displays logs of a specific container
